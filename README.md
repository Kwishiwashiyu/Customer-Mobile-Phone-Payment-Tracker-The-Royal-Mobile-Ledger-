# 👑 The Royal Phone Ledger: Customer Mobile Phone Payment Tracker

A Python-based application using Tkinter for the GUI and MySQL (via XAMPP) for database management, designed to track mobile phone installment plans, payments, and overdue accounts within a feudal, medieval theme.

## 💾 Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.x:** (Ensure Python and `pip` are in your system's PATH).
2.  **XAMPP:** (To run the Apache web server and MySQL database).
3.  **Required Python Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install mysql-connector-python python-dateutil
    ```

## 🚀 Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the database and run the application.

### Step 1: Database Setup (MySQL)

The application requires a MySQL database named `TheRoyalPhoneLedger`.

1.  **Start XAMPP:** Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and click **Start** for both **Apache** and **MySQL**.

2.  **Open phpMyAdmin:** Navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser.

3.  **Create Database:**

      * Click the **Databases** tab.
      * Enter `TheRoyalPhoneLedger` as the database name and click **Create**.

4.  **Create Tables:**

      * Click on the newly created `TheRoyalPhoneLedger` database.
      * Click the **SQL** tab and execute the following schema script to create the necessary tables (`customers`, `phones`, `installment_plans`, `payments`):

    <!-- end list -->

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE customers (
        customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        first_name VARCHAR(50), last_name VARCHAR(50), contact VARCHAR(30), address TEXT
    );
    CREATE TABLE phones (
        phone_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        model_name VARCHAR(100), brand VARCHAR(50), price DECIMAL(10,2), stock INT
    );
    CREATE TABLE installment_plans (
        installment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT, phone_id INT, purchase_date DATE, months INT, interest_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
        total_amount DECIMAL(10,2), monthly_payment DECIMAL(10,2), remaining_balance DECIMAL(10,2),
        status VARCHAR(20), FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (phone_id) REFERENCES phones(phone_id)
    );
    CREATE TABLE payments (
        payment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, installment_id INT, payment_date DATE,
        amount DECIMAL(10,2), remarks VARCHAR(100), FOREIGN KEY (installment_id) REFERENCES installment_plans(installment_id)
    );
    ```

### Step 2: Inject Dummy Data (Optional, but Recommended for Testing)

To test the Overdue Report feature immediately, run the provided data injector script.

1.  Place the `Data_dummy.py` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python Data_dummy.py
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Application

Execute the main file to launch the GUI:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a clean, modular structure:

## ⚙️ Database Configuration

The system connects to `localhost` using the default XAMPP credentials (`root` with an empty password) and the database name `MobilePaymentTracker`. This is defined in `db.py`.

```python
# db.py
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'root',
    'password': '',
    'database': 'TheRoyalPhoneLedger'
}
```
